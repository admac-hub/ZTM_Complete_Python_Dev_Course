Now we're still scratching the surface here, but we now go into an area that gets really, really exciting

because up until now, what we've been doing is this every time we write code, we do something here

and then we go to the second line and do something else, and then finally go to the third line and

do something else and so on and so forth.

Our Python interpreter just went line by line one, all the way to whatever line number we have on our

Dot Pi file and just ran the code.

And it ran really fast because machines are good at that.

They run code really fast.

But we haven't discovered the true power of programming and specifically programming for machines.

You see, the power comes when we start to incorporate the idea of maybe running multiple lines over

and over or maybe skipping a line and going from line one to line three.

And in this section, we're going to talk about the idea of conditions and conditional logic.

1 DO SOMETHING 
2 DO SOMETHING 
3 DO SOMETHING
