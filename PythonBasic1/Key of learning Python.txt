The key of learning new language are the :

1.Terms 

First are the terms of that language.
Sometimes a programming language has different words and different definitions for these words that
you're going to have to memorize things like statements, variables, instantiation.
Really complicated sounding words.
But you need to understand what they mean so that you can talk to other programmers.

2.Data Types 
 
That is, what sort of data can a program hold?
You can think of it as a values.
Just like in real life, we have different ways to represent values like numbers, letters and symbols.
In programming, we have these data types to store information, and each programming language has different
sort of data types.

a) Fundamental Data Types

int   -  represent all numbers
float -  floating point numbers
bool  -
str   -  represent All letters
list  -
tuple -
set   -
dict  -


b) Classes -> Custom Types 


c) Specialized Data Types
we retrive them from modules when we don`t want to create our one 


d) None 
means nothing type , the absolute nothing




3.Actions 

All programming is is a way for us to tell our machines, Hey, store this data and then retrieve this
data and perform some action on it.
That's all it is, just using memory and performing some actions.

print() - is an action / the bracket saying : - Perfom  the action on this data types
